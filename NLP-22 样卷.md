$P(fly|V) = \frac {300}{20000}$
...
#### b)The problem of unigram POS tagger
1. ***Context-insensitivity***: Unigram POS taggers do not consider the context in which a word appears. This can lead to incorrect POS tags for words with multiple meanings (homonyms and polysemous words) depending on the context.
2. ***Inability to handle rare or unknown words***: Unigram POS taggers rely on the frequency of words in the training corpus to assign POS tags. Consequently, they might struggle to handle words that are rare or not present in the training data. This issue can lead to incorrect POS tags for such words.
3. ***Limited accuracy***: Unigram POS taggers typically have lower accuracy compared to more advanced POS tagging methods that consider contextual information, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF), or neural network-based POS taggers.
4. ***Dependence on the training corpus***: The performance of a unigram POS tagger heavily depends on the quality and size of the training corpus. If the training data is not representative of the text to be tagged or if it is too small, the unigram POS tagger's performance may be compromised.
5. ***Lack of sequence information***: Unigram POS taggers do not consider the relationships between consecutive words or POS tags in a sentence, which can provide valuable information for assigning the correct POS tags.
